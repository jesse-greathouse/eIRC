# eIRC: An Enterprise Chat System Based on IRC

## Overview

**eIRC** is a modern, scalable enterprise messaging architecture built on the IRC protocol. Designed for organizations that require ephemeral, real-time communication without the heavy operational overhead of pub/sub systems like Apache Kafka, eIRC delivers high-throughput, low-latency chat experiences while minimizing memory and CPU usage per user.

## ðŸ“Œ User Identity [Synchronization & Authentication](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesse-greathouse/eIRC/refs/heads/main/eIRC-Identity-Synchronization-and-Authentication.pdf)

The system is composed of three core architectural tiers:

1. **Frontend Client** (any browser-based or native application)
2. **Session Bridge Layer** (WebSocket server running in OpenResty, per-user IRC client process)
3. **Infrastructure Services** (IRC server, Laravel-based backend, persistent database)

---

## 1. Frontend Client

### Description

The frontend is a JavaScript application built with Vue 3 and Inertia.js. However, eIRC is **frontend-agnostic**: any application capable of opening a WebSocket and handling IRC-style messages can integrate with the backend.

### Responsibilities

- Authenticate user via OAuth2 (Laravel Passport)
- Request short-lived `chat_token` from Laravel (`/chat` route)
- Open WebSocket connection to OpenResty using `chat_token`
- Display incoming IRC messages
- Send user input as raw IRC protocol lines (e.g., `PRIVMSG`, `JOIN`)

---

## 2. Session Bridge Layer

### WebSocket Server (OpenResty + Lua)

#### WebSocket Description

Built inside Nginx workers using the `lua-resty-websocket` and `ngx.pipe` libraries, this layer bridges the frontend and backend without external WebSocket daemons or Node.js servers.

#### WebSocket Responsibilities

- Accept WebSocket upgrade requests
- Validate `chat_token` via internal API call to Laravel (`/api/auth/user/{tokenId}`)
- Spawn a per-user `irc-client` process using `ngx.pipe`
- Connect to the IRC client via a UNIX socket
- Stream IRC messages from the client to the browser
- Forward browser input to the IRC client
- Handle lifecycle cleanup (WebSocket close, IRC process shutdown)

### IRC Client (C++23)

#### Client Description

A small, memory-efficient IRC protocol proxy. Each user connection results in one instance of this process. It connects to the IRC server and communicates with the WebSocket server over a UNIX domain socket.

#### Client Responsibilities

- Authenticate and connect to InspIRCd
- Join channels as directed
- Parse IRC messages and return them via UNIX socket
- Accept frontend commands via socket and translate to IRC protocol
- Shut down cleanly on quit or socket disconnect

#### Resource Usage

- 10 MB resident memory per process
- Minimal CPU load during idle; spiky under large IRC traffic bursts
- Native compiled with ASIO for networking and Ncurses/Unix socket for I/O abstraction

---

## 3. Infrastructure Services

### IRC Server (InspIRCd)

#### Server Description

A standard IRC daemon which handles routing, presence, and channel state. No modification required. It is treated as a pure message bus.

#### Server Responsibilities

- Handle all IRC protocol delivery
- Manage channels, users, joins, parts, and messages
- Coordinate presence and mode tracking
- Optionally clustered (hub-spoke or spanning tree)

### Laravel Backend

#### Laravel Description

A Laravel 12 application responsible for persistent user management, chatroom metadata, and issuing short-lived tokens.

#### Laravel Responsibilities

- User authentication via Laravel Passport
- Chatroom metadata API
- OAuth-based login and token issuance
- Serve Inertia-powered frontend for chat UI
- Issue and invalidate `chat_token` for WebSocket auth

### Database (PostgreSQL or MySQL)

#### Database Responsibilities

- Store user profiles, nicknames, preferences
- Track persistent chatroom metadata
- Store issued access tokens for temporary chat access
- Optionally log IRC messages (for analytics or compliance)

---

## Token-Based Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via Laravel UI
2. Laravel issues a short-lived `chat_token` (valid for 3 minutes)
3. Browser sends WebSocket connection request with `?chat_token=xyz`
4. WebSocket server validates token via internal HTTP API to Laravel
5. If valid, binds token to Nginx `request_id` in `ngx.shared.DICT`
6. Spawns IRC client process for that session

Tokens are:

- Bound to one connection only
- Deleted after use or timeout
- Prevent session reuse across tabs/devices

---

## Message Flow Diagram

1. Browser âŸ¶ WebSocket: `wss://server/chat?chat_token=abc`
2. WebSocket âŸ¶ Laravel API: `/api/auth/user/{tokenId}`
3. WebSocket âŸ¶ Spawn IRC client via `ngx.pipe`
4. WebSocket âŸ¶ Connect to `irc-client.sock`
5. IRC Client âŸ¶ InspIRCd: `CONNECT`, `NICK`, `USER`, etc.
6. IRC âŸ¶ IRC Client âŸ¶ WebSocket âŸ¶ Browser

---

## Scalability Considerations

### Vertical Scaling

- WebSocket server runs inside Nginx workers (~20 MB each)
- IRC clients: 10 MB each Ã— N users = predictable memory curve
- Suitable for bare-metal or virtual Linux hosts with high thread count

### Horizontal Scaling

- Stateless WebSocket workers can be scaled across machines
- Token binding is enforced per instance via shared memory (per Nginx worker)
- Laravel backend and database can be clustered
- IRC server clustering is supported via InspIRCdâ€™s native configuration

---

## Deployment Model

**Recommended Setup:**

- 1 physical or VM host
- Nginx + OpenResty
- PHP-FPM for Laravel
- Redis (optional, for central cache)
- InspIRCd daemon

### Processes

- 1 Nginx master + N workers
- 1 PHP-FPM pool
- 1 irc-client process per active user

---

## Optional Extensions

- **Message Logging:** Use a logger bot to stream messages to Elasticsearch or Redis Streams
- **IRC History Bridge:** Implement Redis-backed buffer for message replay
- **UI Clients:** Native mobile apps, Electron clients, embedded widgets
- **Audit Trails:** Laravel logs all chat_token issuances and user metadata updates

## Advantages Over Kafka-Based Systems

| Feature               | eIRC (IRC-Based)        | Kafka-Based System        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Memory per connection | ~10MB                   | High (JVM overhead)       |
| Delivery latency      | <10ms                   | ~100ms+                   |
| Storage requirements  | None (ephemeral)        | Always-on logging         |
| Protocol complexity   | Simple text-based IRC   | Avro/Protobuf, partitions |
| Fan-out/multiplexing  | Via InspIRCd clustering | Native pub/sub            |
| Replay                | Not built-in            | Built-in                  |
| Cost per message      | Extremely low           | High (CPU + I/O)          |

---

## Summary

**eIRC** offers a highly efficient alternative to heavyweight enterprise messaging systems. By leveraging IRCâ€™s lightweight protocol, combining it with modern WebSocket infrastructure, and introducing per-user process isolation, it achieves:

- Portability
- Ephemeral real-time communication
- Low infrastructure cost
- Easy integration into existing frontends

This system is best suited for organizations seeking a **chat layer** that is:

- Ephemeral by design
- Not reliant on persistent log streams
- Lightweight enough for embedded use
- Secure through token-based, OAuth-integrated flows

---

## Minimum System Requirements

- Linux host with:
  - 4+ CPU cores
  - 8+ GB RAM (for ~500 simultaneous users)
  - SSD storage for logs and tokens
- Installed services:
  - OpenResty (with lua-resty modules)
  - InspIRCd
  - PHP 8.3 + Laravel 12
  - Redis (optional)
  - PostgreSQL or MySQL
